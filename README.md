📌 Problem Statement
Accurate rain prediction is essential for planning and safety in sectors like agriculture, aviation, and disaster management. This project uses a weather dataset to build a classifier that predicts whether it will rain the next day.

🔍 Dataset
Source: Rain in Australia dataset

Description: Daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.

Target Variable: RainTomorrow (Yes/No)

⚠️ Note: Due to GitHub’s file size limitations, the dataset is not uploaded here. You can download it from the Kaggle link above and place it in the appropriate directory.
